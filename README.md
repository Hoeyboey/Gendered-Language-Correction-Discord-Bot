# Gendered-Language-Correction-Discord-Bot

Because I think it's important people are given tools to correct people without putting themselves into hostile situations, this is a Discord bot that monitors the text channels of server it's in, and will call it out if it sees someone say "Dude", "Dudes", or "Guys".

It's almost done! So, currently, it will call people out, and the owner of a server is able to remove words from the default 
blacklist. Next up is adding functionality to add to the blacklist, and then it's able to be spread AROUND THE WORLD.

Note - the token for my bot isn't in the code, it's put in as an argument when I run it.

Written in Python, using discord.py!
