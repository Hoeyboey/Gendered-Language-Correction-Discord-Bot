# Gendered-Language-Correction-Discord-Bot

Because I think it's important people are given tools to correct people without putting themselves into hostile situations, this is a Discord bot that monitors the text channels of server it's in, and will call it out if it sees someone say "Dude", "Dudes", or "Guys".

There's also some rudimentary functionality for creating your own blacklists - currently, there's only one main blacklist, but next addition is making server-specific blacklists so I can actually let people use it.

Note - the token for my bot isn't in the code, I've taken that out so you can't steal it and make me look bad by making it do questionable things.

Written in Python, using discord.py!
